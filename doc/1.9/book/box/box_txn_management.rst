Functions for transaction management
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

===============================================================================
                                   Overview
===============================================================================

For general information and examples, see section
:ref:`Transaction control <atomic-atomic_execution>`.

Observe the following rules when working with transactions:

.. admonition:: Rule #1
    :class: FACT

    The requests in a transaction must be sent to a server as a single block.
    It is not enough to enclose them between begin and commit or rollback.
    To ensure they are sent as a single block: put them in a function, or put
    them all on one line, or use a delimiter so that multi-line requests
    are handled together.

.. admonition:: Rule #2
    :class: FACT

    All database operations in a transaction should use the same storage engine.
    It is not safe to access tuple sets that are defined with ``{engine='vinyl'}``
    and also access tuple sets that are defined with ``{engine='memtx'}``,
    in the same transaction.

.. admonition:: Rule #3
    :class: FACT

    Requests which cause changes to the data definition
    -- create, alter, drop, truncate -- must not be used.

Below is a list of all functions for transaction management.

    +--------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
    | Name                                 | Use                             |
    +======================================+=================================+
    | :ref:`box.begin()                    | Begin the transaction           |
    | <box-begin>`                         |                                 |
    +--------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
    | :ref:`box.commit()                   | End the transaction and save    |
    | <box-commit>`                        | all changes                     |
    +--------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
    | :ref:`box.rollback()                 | End the transaction and discard |
    | <box-rollback>`                      | all changes                     |
    +--------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
    | :ref:`box.savepoint()                | Get a savepoint descriptor      |
    | <box-savepoint>`                     |                                 |
    +--------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
    | :ref:`box.rollback_to_savepoint()    | Do not end the transaction and  |
    | <box-rollback_to_savepoint>`         | discard all changes made after  |
    |                                      | a savepoint                     |
    +--------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
    | :ref:`box.atomic()                   | Execute a function, treating it |
    | <box-atomic>`                        | as a transaction                |
    +--------------------------------------+---------------------------------+

.. _box-begin:

.. function:: box.begin()

    Begin the transaction. Disable :ref:`implicit yields <atomic-implicit-yields>`
    until the transaction ends.
    Signal that writes to the :ref:`write-ahead log <internals-wal>` will be
    deferred until the transaction ends.
    In effect the fiber which executes ``box.begin()`` is starting an "active
    multi-request transaction", blocking all other fibers.

    :return: error if this operation is not permitted because there 
             is already an active transaction.

    :return: error if for some reason memory cannot be allocated.

.. _box-commit:

.. function:: box.commit()

    End the transaction, and make all its data-change operations permanent.

    :return: error and abort the transaction in case of a conflict.

    :return: error if the operation fails to write to disk.

    :return: error if for some reason memory cannot be allocated.

.. _box-rollback:

.. function:: box.rollback()

    End the transaction, but cancel all its data-change operations.
    An explicit call to functions outside ``box.space`` that always
    yield, such as :ref:`fiber.sleep() <fiber-sleep>` or
    :ref:`fiber.yield() <fiber-yield>`, will have the same effect.

.. _box-savepoint:

.. function:: box.savepoint()

    Return a descriptor of a savepoint (with ``table`` type), which can be used 
    later by :ref:`box.rollback_to_savepoint(savepoint) <box-rollback_to_savepoint>`.
    Savepoints can only be created while a transaction is active, and they are
    destroyed when a transaction ends.

    :return: ``savepoint table``
    :rtype:  Lua object

    :return: error if the savepoint cannot be set in absence of active 
             transaction.

    :return: error if for some reason memory cannot be allocated.

.. _box-rollback_to_savepoint:

.. function:: box.rollback_to_savepoint(savepoint)

    Do not end the transaction, but cancel all its data-change
    and :ref:`box.savepoint() <box-savepoint>` operations that were done after
    the specified savepoint.

    :return: error if the savepoint cannot be set in absence of active 
             transaction.

    :return: error if the savepoint does not exist.

    **Example:**

    .. code-block:: lua

        function f()
          box.begin()           -- start transaction
          box.space.t:insert{1} -- this will not be rolled back
          local s = box.savepoint()
          box.space.t:insert{2} -- this will be rolled back
          box.rollback_to_savepoint(s)
          box.commit()          -- end transaction
        end

.. _box-atomic:

.. function:: box.atomic(function-name [, function-arguments])

    Execute a function, acting as if the function starts with an implicit
    :ref:`box.begin() <box-begin>` and ends with an implicit
    :ref:`box.commit() <box-commit>` if successful, or ends with an implicit
    :ref:`box.rollback() <box-rollback>` if there is an error.

    :return: the result of the function passed to ``atomic()`` as an argument.

    :return: any error that :ref:`box.begin() <box-begin>` and 
             :ref:`box.commit() <box-commit>` can return.
