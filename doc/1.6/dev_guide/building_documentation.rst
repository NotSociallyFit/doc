Building documentation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tarantool documentation is built using a simplified markup system named ``Sphinx``
(see http://sphinx-doc.org). You can build a local version of this documentation
and you can contribute to Tarantool's version.

You need to install these packages:

* ``git`` (a program for downloading source repositories)
* ``CMake`` version 2.8 or later (a program for managing the build process)
* ``Python`` version greater than 2.6 -- preferably 2.7 -- and less than 3.0
  (Sphinx is a Python-based tool)
* ``LaTeX`` (a system for document preparation, the installable
  package name usually begins with the word texlive or tetex, on Ubuntu
  the name is texlive-latex-base)

You need to install these Python modules:

* `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_, any version
* `Sphinx <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Sphinx>`_ version 1.4.4 or later
* `sphinx-intl <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinx-intl>`_ version 0.9.9
* `lupa <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lupa>`_ -- any version

See more details about installation in the :ref:`build-from-source <building_from_source>`
section of this documentation.

1. Use ``git`` to download the latest source code of this documentation from the
   GitHub repository ``tarantool/doc``, branch 1.6. For example, to download to a local
   directory named ``~/tarantool-doc``:

   .. code-block:: bash

     git clone https://github.com/tarantool/doc.git ~/tarantool-doc

2. Use ``CMake`` to initiate the build.

   .. code-block:: bash

     cd ~/tarantool-doc
     make clean         # unnecessary, added for good luck
     rm CMakeCache.txt  # unnecessary, added for good luck
     cmake .            # initiate

3. Build a local version of the documentation.

   Run the ``make`` command with an appropriate option to specify which
   documentation version to build.

   .. code-block:: bash

     cd ~/tarantool-doc
     make sphinx-html           # multi-page English version
     make sphinx-singlehtml     # one-page English version
     make sphinx-html-ru        # multi-page Russian version
     make sphinx-singlehtml-ru  # one-page Russian version
     make all                   # all versions plus the entire web-site

   Documentation will be created in subdirectories of ``/output``:

   * ``/output/en`` (files of the English version)
   * ``/output/ru`` (files of the Russian version)

   The entry point for each version is the ``index.html`` file in the appropriate
   directory.

4. Set up a web server.

   * One way is to run the ``sphinx-webserver`` rule from our makefile.
     This will set up and run the web server on port ``8000``:

     .. code-block:: console

         $ cd ~/tarantool-doc
         $ make sphinx-html       # as an example, build the multi-page English documentation
         $ make sphinx-webserver  # set up and run the web server

     In case port ``8000`` is already in use, you can specify any other port
     number that is bigger than ``1000`` in the ``tarantool-doc/CMakeLists.txt``
     file (search it for the ``sphinx-webserver`` target) and rebuild cmake
     files:

     .. code-block:: console

         $ cd ~/tarantool-doc
         $ git clean -qfxd        # clean up old cmake files
         $ cmake .                # rebuild cmake files
         $ make sphinx-html       # as an example, build the multi-page English documentation
         $ make sphinx-webserver  # set up and run the web server on the custom port

     Or you can release the port:

     .. code-block:: console

         $ sudo lsof -i :8000  # get the process ID (PID)
         COMMAND PID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
         Python 19516 user 3u IPv4 0xe7f8gc6be1b43c7 0t0 TCP *:irdmi (LISTEN)
         $ sudo kill -9 19516  # kill the process

   * The other way is to run the built-in web server in Python.
     Make sure to run it from the documentation ``output`` folder:

     .. code-block:: console

         $ cd ~/tarantool-doc/output
         $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

     In case port ``8000`` is already in use, you can specify any other port
     number that is bigger than ``1000``.

5. Open your browser and enter ``127.0.0.1:8000/en/doc/1.9`` into the address
   box (or ``127.0.0.1:8000/ru/doc/1.9`` if you built the Russian documentation).
   If your local documentation build is valid, the manual will appear in
   the browser.

6. To contribute to documentation, use the
   `REST <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickstart.html>`_
   format for drafting and submit your updates as a
   `pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/>`_
   via GitHub.

   To comply with the writing and formatting style, use the
   :ref:`guidelines <documentation_guidelines>` provided in the documentation,
   common sense and existing documents.

.. NOTE::

    * If you suggest creating a new documentation section (a whole new
      page), it has to be saved to the relevant section at GitHub.

    * If you want to contribute to localizing this documentation (for example into
      Russian), add your translation strings to ``.po`` files stored in the
      corresponding locale directory (for example ``/locale/ru/LC_MESSAGES/``
      for Russian). See more about localizing with Sphinx at
      http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/intl.html
